# Materials for Project 3

## Rationale
Welcome and thank you for considering our work for Project 3!<br>
Reasons to use this project:
- <b>Easy to install!</b> Simply clone the repo and get up and running in Chrome with 3 clicks.
- <b>Easy to quantify!</b> A simple math test will show how much time this extension saves over using a calculator or search engine.
- <b>Easy to use!</b> Just highlight a value and unit with your cursor and the app does the rest.

This means you can get your testers online and providing meaningful data within 2 minutes, saving valuable testing time.

#### The Test: Does the Smart Units converter app save time and improve accuracy of conversions vs other tools like Google?

## Materials Provided
-   Sample experimental protocol
-   Proposed metrics
-   Developer support - got questions? We've got answers!
-   Premade Google Forms math test - auto-graded, auto-shuffled, and ready to use!

## Proposed Metrics
-   Time to finish test
-   Number of questions completed
-   Avg. time per question
-   Ratio of correct answers
-   Tools used other than Smart Units
-   Preferred tool - Smart Units app or other?

## Proposed Testing Protocol
1. To maximize data, we suggest having each tester spend time on two paradigms: <b>it</b>, aka this extension, and <b>not it</b>, aka any other tools.
2. Using our premade math test or another similar evaluation of your creation, have each tester answer as many conversions as possible with each tool set.
3. Begin a timer at the start of each segment, stopping the tester after 25 minutes have elapsed or the test has been completed, whichever occurs first.
4. During tester sessions note the time required to complete each version of the test and what tools are used in the "not it" paradigm.
5. Two segments of 25 minutes leaves 10 minutes remaining for tester instructions, setup, and any optional qualitative assessment you wish to give.

-   Notes:
    -   Upon transfer of this project, we will duplicate the Google Forms resources and send them to your team to own.
    -   As Currency conversions use live exchange rates, this feature cannot have auto-graded questions.
    
## Testing Materials
### Quizzes
[Google form without extension](https://forms.gle/iLR7pnQmWkTWYFpBA)

[Google form with extension](https://forms.gle/n3SDNhPE5p5eDbZJ6)

The first quiz has a link to the second.

### Time Tracking
We will record the time it took each participant to answer each question in seconds. To capture this, we will copy their participation token into another sheet and later combine our quizzes and our observation sheet for our anaylsis. We will use this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELbdBy0VkcmrFD7b4gYCQ_V5RlJtX6giR6ps5TzmwQY/edit?usp=sharing) to record times.
