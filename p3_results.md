# Experiment Conclusions

Our data and visualizations can be seen at this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELbdBy0VkcmrFD7b4gYCQ_V5RlJtX6giR6ps5TzmwQY/edit#gid=0). Some visualizations and summaries are provided inline below.

## Methods

We studied 10 different participants who went about testing our unit converter extension. Each particpant had 60 minutes to calculate certain values with and without the help of the unit converter extension. We assigned each particpant 2 Google forms [Form1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFFbaXtMoxbzXF057jp3BFg0NaoRiNNid-qNR28nhi2NzZSw/viewform) and [Form2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWDTLWTeiQgacUpCE_Qu_oP_zpBM_aOjExY3HrF3yvlkBdTA/viewform) and got them to fill theese forms up without and with the help of the unit converter extension respectively. We observered their progress via Zoom screen sessions. 

Our participants had to download the repository, and enable the extension as shown in [README.md](https://github.com/harshkachhadia/units_converter_extension)


## Materials

The participant had to download our repository to conduct our experiment. We used this method for each participant. 

We utilized [Google form 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFFbaXtMoxbzXF057jp3BFg0NaoRiNNid-qNR28nhi2NzZSw/viewform) and [Google form 2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWDTLWTeiQgacUpCE_Qu_oP_zpBM_aOjExY3HrF3yvlkBdTA/viewform) for capturing user feedback. 
The following responses were taken in Form1:

* Token Number?
* Conversion of km in miles? 
* Conversion of days in seconds?
* Conversion of Fahrenhiet to Celcius? 
 
The following responses were taken in Form2:

* Token Number?
* Conversion of km in miles? 
* Conversion of days in seconds?
* Conversion of Fahrenhiet to Celcius? 
* On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being easiest and 5 being hardest), how easy was the extension to install? 
* On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being easiest and 5 being hardest), how easy was the extension to use for conversion?
* Do you plan to use this extension in the future? 


## Observations

1. From the graph we see that the average ease of running a language was the highest for Dart followed by Lua and then Golang.
2. From the graph we see that the confidence of the user that a bug was fixed was the highest for Lua followed by Golang and then Dart.
3. From the graph we see that the people debugging the code found Dart to be easiest followed by Golang and then Lua.
4. Prior programming experience with a similar language aids a programmer in debugging an uncommon language with respect to language syntaxes and rules.
5. Debugging was comparatively easier for participants who had coded Game of Life in some other language familier to them.(makes thier logic clear)
6. Participants faced less difficulties in debugging codes that contained meaningful variable naming and comments all over the code.



## Conclusions

1. Even though the people debugging the code found Dart to be the easiest to understand, they were least confident in fixing the bugs.
2. Even though the people debugging the code found Lua to be the toughest to understand, they were most confident in fixing the bugs.
3. People debugging the code found Golang in between Lua and Dart in easiness to understand and in confidence of fixing the bug.
1. It is easy to learn a new language, if you have previously worked with some language following same programming paradigm.
2. Prior understanding of flow and logic of the program has proved out to be a necessary condition before starting code debugging.
3. Proper variable naming convention and documentation of code with comments aids an external person a lot, while debugging or understanding the code.
