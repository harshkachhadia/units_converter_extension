# Experiment Conclusions

Our data and visualizations can be seen at this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELbdBy0VkcmrFD7b4gYCQ_V5RlJtX6giR6ps5TzmwQY/edit#gid=0). Some visualizations and summaries are provided inline below.

## Methods

We studied 10 different participants who went about testing our unit converter extension. Each particpant had 60 minutes to calculate certain values with and without the help of the unit converter extension. We assigned each particpant 2 Google forms [Form1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFFbaXtMoxbzXF057jp3BFg0NaoRiNNid-qNR28nhi2NzZSw/viewform) and [Form2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWDTLWTeiQgacUpCE_Qu_oP_zpBM_aOjExY3HrF3yvlkBdTA/viewform) and got them to fill theese forms up without and with the help of the unit converter extension respectively. We observered their progress via Zoom screen sessions. 

Our participants had to download the repository, and enable the extension as shown in [README.md](https://github.com/harshkachhadia/units_converter_extension)


## Materials

The participant had to download our repository to conduct our experiment. We used this method for each participant. 

We utilized [Google form 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFFbaXtMoxbzXF057jp3BFg0NaoRiNNid-qNR28nhi2NzZSw/viewform) and [Google form 2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWDTLWTeiQgacUpCE_Qu_oP_zpBM_aOjExY3HrF3yvlkBdTA/viewform) for capturing user feedback. 
The following responses were taken in Form1:

* Token Number?
* Conversion of km in miles? 
* Conversion of days in seconds?
* Conversion of Fahrenhiet to Celcius? 
 
The following responses were taken in Form2:

* Token Number?
* Conversion of km in miles? 
* Conversion of days in seconds?
* Conversion of Fahrenhiet to Celcius? 
* On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being easiest and 5 being hardest), how easy was the extension to install? 
* On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being easiest and 5 being hardest), how easy was the extension to use for conversion?
* Do you plan to use this extension in the future?
